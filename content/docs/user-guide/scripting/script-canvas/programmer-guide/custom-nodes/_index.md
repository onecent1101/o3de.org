## Feature overview
Creating custom nodes in Script Canvas offers you maximum control and flexibility with the functionality of the node. 
You might wish to a create custom node in the following scenarios:

* When your node has state, time, or latent results.
* When creating complex nodes.
* When you need control over the node's topology.
* When you want to reflect your own C++ free functions. 

To make the process of creating a custom node easier, Script Canvas uses a templated, automatic code generation system called [AzAutoGen](/docs/user-guide/programming/autogen/)
to significantly reduce the amount of "boilerplate code" you need to write just to get a node up and running, allowing the developer to immediately focus on the functionality of the new node,
since the code required for the node to show up in the [Node Palette](/docs/user-guide/scripting/script-canvas/get-started/concepts-and-terms/#node-palette) is already there.

The following four steps are required to create a custom node:

1. Create a code generation XML file.
2. Create the C++ files for your node.
3. Add these files to CMake.
4. Register your new node.
